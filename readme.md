# README

Things I wanted to try during this project :

- Making a DearImGui app so I can compare the ease of use with DearPyGui
- Practicing some Cpp as I'm not that familiar with it
- Creating an annotation tool for computer vision
- Learning how to use various libraries in a project

Additional libraries:

- [Add-on to be able to handle file dialogs](https://github.com/aiekick/ImGuiFileDialog)
- [Very complete logging library](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
- [Single file library](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
