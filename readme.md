# README

## Things I wanted to try during this project

- Making a DearImGui app so I can compare the ease of use with DearPyGui
- Practicing some Cpp as I'm not that familiar with it
- Creating an annotation tool for computer vision
- Learning how to use various libraries in a project
- Using CMake (handling dependencies)
- Basic manipulation of images with OpenGL backend

## Libraries used in this project

- [DearImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git)
- [Add-on to DearImGUI to be able to handle file dialogs](https://github.com/aiekick/ImGuiFileDialog)
- [Very complete logging library](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
- [Single file library](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
- [Json file handler](https://github.com/nlohmann/json.git)
- [Finite State Machine](https://github.com/eglimi/cppfsm.git)

## TODO

- [ ] Finish basic logic
- [ ] CMake (dependencies + build folder etc. + cross-compilation)
